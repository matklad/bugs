Some bugs I've created *and noticed*.

1. Python. Typo in

def sorted_blocks(blocks):
    """Turn a stream of blocks into a stream of sorted blocks"""

    for block in blocks:
        yield sorted(blocks)

blocks -> block.

Fixes:

* type system
* name short lived `block` as `b`
* avoid `block` altogether, and use `map`


2. Kotlin. Iterate `Sequence` twice

fun extractErrors(lines: Sequence<String>): Sequence<RawErrorInfo> {
    val matcher = ErrorMatchingDFA()
    return sequence {
        for (line in lines) {
            matcher.feed(line)?.let { return@sequence it }
        }
        return@sequence matcher.feed(null)
    }
}

Fixes:

* Read sequence API thoroughly
* Don't ignore `constrainOnce` function and study it carefully

3. Kotlin. Fallback to the wrong default.

val pathToCargo = settings?.cargoPath ?: CargoConstants.CARGO_EXECUTABLE_NAME

5 min

Fixes:

* don't select a default for the sake of a selected default, investigate the way to signal error.
* read the documentation!

4. Kotlin. Assuming that data classes are serializable

A ton of code to create unnecessary wrapping.

3 days

Fixes:

* question assumptions!
* read the documentation!

5. Kotlin. Wrong automated refactoing.

A shadowing was introduce by auto refactoring lambda to use implicit `it` parameter.

40 min.

Fixes:

* Avoid nested lambdas?

6. Kotlin. Not appending `.exe` to the executable in one of two cases.

When executing a thing, an `.exe` was correctly appended to the path to execute. However, when probing for availability of the thing, `.exe` was not appended.

1 hour

Fixes:

* Don't ignore code smell. Fix low priority issues first?
* Test on windows.
* In `doAction` function, require an evidence that `canDoAction` was called.
