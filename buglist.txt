Some bugs I've created *and noticed*.

1. Python. Typo in

def sorted_blocks(blocks):
    """Turn a stream of blocks into a stream of sorted blocks"""

    for block in blocks:
        yield sorted(blocks)

blocks -> block.

Fixes:

* type system
* name short lived `block` as `b`
* avoid `block` altogether, and use `map`
